Explanation:

Dataset Loading: I loaded the Iris dataset by copying and pasting it directly into my project.

Label Encoding: I encoded the Species column into numbers so the model can understand it.

Feature and Target Split: I stored all the features in X and the target (Species) in y.

Train-Test Split: I split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model properly.

Feature Engineering: I kept it simple, but feature scaling or selection could be done here if needed.

Exploratory Data Analysis: I used a few plots to understand the data better (like scatter plots or histograms).

Decision Tree Training: I used DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn to train the model.

Tree Plotting: I visualized the decision tree using plot_tree() to see how the model makes decisions.

Matplotlib: I used it to display plots and the tree diagram.
